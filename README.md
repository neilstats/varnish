# varnish

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The varnish package provides convenience functions for outputting high
quality tables using existing R packages.

## Installation

This package is in early development.

## flextable

The package initially contains functions for working with the
[flextable](https://davidgohel.github.io/flextable/) package. The
flextable package is used to create tables which can be embedded in R
Markdown documents (for output to HTML, Word, PDF and PowerPoint
documents) or directly in Word and PowerPoint documents using the
[officer](https://ardata-fr.github.io/officeverse) package. The package
is particularly effective for creating custom, high quality tables in
Word documents.
